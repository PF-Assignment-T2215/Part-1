## Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. Making the Alien center 
   * the solution was by getting the values inputted by the users for row and column 
     divide them by 2 then plus 1 

2. Only accepting odd numbers only 
   * The solution was to get the value inputted by the user and if mod equals to 0 
     which means the user has inputted even number thus using if else statment we 
     can create a loop till user enters odd numbers only
